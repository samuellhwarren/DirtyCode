"I want to build a cross-platform desktop application for Windows and macOS called Dirty Code. It should rival SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and support T-SQL, Azure SQL, and SQL Server running on Linux. I plan to use Electron for the app shell, React for the UI, Monaco Editor for SQL editing, and Node.js for backend connectivity. Help me design the architecture, define the core features, and start prototyping the SQL Editor with T-SQL support."
